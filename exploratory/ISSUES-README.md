4/12/2023 Issue

Using my *looped* code:  After images from April through September are stacked, plotting LST throws errors like the following:

ERROR 1: Request for 346275-352174 failed with response_code=0
ERROR 1: _TIFFPartialReadStripArray:Cannot read offset/size for strile around ~184

These errors are not encountered when plotting just April images so it appears there may be an issue with files somewhere along the line.  The same errors are also encountered when using the ORIGINAL QUICKSTART NOTEBOOK for that same April through September time frame.
